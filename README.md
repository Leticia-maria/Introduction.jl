**About Julia**

Julia is a new programming language developed for scientific and numerical programming. As a chemist, how can we use this new tool to improve and implement techniques for molecular modelling? At the end of this workshop, you will be able to answer that question, after introducing the use of the Quantumfoca.jl package and Fermi.jl, the fastest solver for molecular integrals in the world! See you there!
