# The Julia Language crash course for chemists

![](JuliaHistory.png)

**About Julia**

Julia is a new programming language developed for scientific and numerical programming. As a chemist, how can we use this new tool to improve and implement techniques for molecular modelling? At the end of this workshop, you will be able to answer that question and start using Julia for your research.

**How to use this repository**

This repository contains the material used in the workshop. You can clone it and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file. All questions will be opened as issues in this repository, so everybody can see the answers and discuss them. The purpose of this environment is to be friendly and healthy for everyone, so please be kind and respectful. It is okay if we don't have the answer for everything, but we can always try to find it together.
